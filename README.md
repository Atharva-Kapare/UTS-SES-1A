# UTS-SES-1A
This is the repo for the app we had to make in SES 1A

# Topic
We were tasked to create a web-based application that would be used by doctors and patients in order to diagnose illnesses over the internet without in person interaction.

#To-Do
* Need to be able to see the specialities for the doctors in their profile page
* Fix bug where doctors can register without giving their speciality
* Need to make the appointment page available only to the patients
* Need to do some checks in the appointment page, the user should not eb able to book an appointment with incomplete fields

# For the Testers
* Test the functionality of the register page (with bad inputs)
* Test the functionality of the appointments page (with bad inputs)

Clone the github repo to your local device or download it. Double click on index.html, this will take you to the home page of the website from which you can go to the other pages, such as login or register.
